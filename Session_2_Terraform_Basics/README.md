### Note:

1. **What is the difference between an internet gateway and a NAT gateway?**

   - **Internet Gateway:** An Internet Gateway allows resources within your virtual private cloud (VPC) to connect to the internet. Resources that are connected through the Internet Gateway typically have public IP addresses (or Elastic IPs) that make them accessible from the internet. Generally, there are no additional costs for using an Internet Gateway beyond the usual data transfer charges.
   - **NAT Gateway:** A NAT Gateway allows instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevents the internet from initiating connections with those instances. Resources using a NAT Gateway do not have public IP addresses and are not directly accessible from the internet. This setup is used mainly for security and resource encapsulation. Using a NAT Gateway incurs additional charges based on the data processing and the amount of data transferred.

2. **What is the difference between a public IP and an elastic IP?**

   - **Public IPs** are dynamic and change with instance stops/restarts, whereas **Elastic IPs** are static and remain until they are manually detached or released.
   - Elastic IPs incur charges when they are not in use, whereas Public IPs do not have any cost as long as they are attached to a running instance.

3. **I see this error, what happened?**

   ```
   aws_nat_gateway.ngw: Creation complete after 1m44s [id=nat-00eb712ccf8f4a866]

   ```
   The error message "0.0.0.0/0" is not a valid IPv6 CIDR block indicates that you've incorrectly used an IPv4 CIDR block where an IPv6 CIDR block is expected.

4. **Why, if the NAT is already assigned with an Elastic IP, does it still need to be put in a subnet?**

   The NAT Gateway needs to be placed in a public subnet because it must have the ability to send and receive traffic directly to and from the internet. A public subnet in AWS is defined as any subnet which has a route out to the internet through an internet gateway.
